    """The cycle a posting's own text states, or None.

    Precision-first, but ordered. Evidence comes in three strengths, and a
    weaker tier may never contradict a stronger one:

      1. An explicit "<Term> <Year>" ("Fall 2026 Internship"). This is the
         employer naming the cycle outright.
      2. A program DATE RANGE ("September 14 – December 4, 2026"), read from
         its start month — the term the program begins in.
      3. A lone "<Month> <Year>".

    The tiers exist because flattening them was actively wrong: Toshiba's
    posting opens with "Fall 2026 Internship" and later gives dates ending
    "December 4, 2026". December maps to Winter, so the set became
    {Fall 2026, Winter 2026}, disagreed with itself, and returned None — and
    the role stayed bucketed under a date-inferred *Summer 2027*. A stated
    term now wins outright; months are only consulted when nothing is stated.

    Within a tier, every counted mention must still agree. A mention counts
    only when internship-ish words sit within `near` characters, the year is
    plausible for a live posting (this year .. +2), and the same sentence
    doesn't frame it as a graduation/company date.
