"""Self-check: every open role must satisfy every accuracy invariant.

    python tools/verify_accuracy.py        # exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations

Checks each OPEN role in data/jobs.json against the rules the pipeline promises:
  1. season is a tracked cycle
  2. a title that states a tracked term+year agrees with the assigned season
  3. no title states an off-cycle year (those must be tombstoned, never listed)
  4. the location passes the US filter (config regions honored)
  5. it still matches the configured role scope (title-level filters)
  6. a real posted date exists and is inside max_age_days
  7. inferred (~) rows carry a posted date (that date is the inference's basis)
  8. the company isn't blocklisted
Plus cross-artifact consistency: the JSON API's open count matches the store.

Run it after any filter change or store surgery — it's the "did we break the
list" button.
